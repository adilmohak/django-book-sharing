# Django Book Sharing app
My portfolio website -> https://ezop.herokuapp.com

This project is a **django** app that allows users to share, discuss, rate, like books and so on.
The app also recommend books depending on the user interest. I used Bootstrap for the front-end part

# Current features
* News and Events
* Add Books
* Share >>
* Rate >>
* Like >>
* Write a review for each book
* Edit your review
* Creat own BookList(shelf)
* Add books to your Booklist
* Book recommendation depending on your interest
* One of the coolest feature of this app is a MultiModel search engine. You can search Books, Users, and News and Events in a single search engine
